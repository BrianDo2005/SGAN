# Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks


This repository contains code for the paper "[Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04357)". Part of the code is modified from OpenAI's [implementation](https://github.com/openai/improved-gan) of Improved GAN.

Currently only the code for MNIST experiments is available. I am working hard to polish the code for SVHN/CIFAR-10 experiments and will push them to this repository as soon as possible.

## Usage

run a simple experiment with independent training only:
```
cd mnist
THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu,floatX=float32 python train_independent.py
```

or with joint training (from scratch):

```
THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu,floatX=float32 python train_joint.py
```
